# Personal Logo & Inspiration

## A Bit of Personal History

I have been a longtime fan of JRR Tolkien and Lord of the Rings. Being born in the year 2000 I have only known a world where the Peter Jackson trilogy, the best series of films ever produced, has existed. However, despite practically growing up in Middle-Earth, it wasn't until my early 20s that I actually read the books. As a matter of fact, during my teenage years I would use this rotten joke asking _why read books? Books burn_... Something of which I am quite proud to have grown out of.

Through this, at the time painstaking, journey of reading The Lord of the Rings for the first time I fell in love with the world of my childhood yet again. I began reading in 2020 so evidently it became my pandemic obsession- _Middle-Earth_. A beautiful world of imagination where you allow your mind to be set free guided by the principles of Tolkien's world. Which is fundamentally grounded in the Truth known to the soul of every man.

It was during this pandemic time that I became infatuated with Tolkiens work. I began to buy artwork depicting his scenery. I expanded my collection of books that would continue to pile up into the years with different editions representing different interpretations of his work in cover art. It has led me to today where I have a whole shelf in my library dedicated to his works and works on him. Now, it is this same personal library, or rather, section of it, that I turned to to find inspiration for a personal logo. For there is no writer richer in imagery than Tolkien himself. His crest written on every binding of his works is an absolute testament to that.

So there is where I found inspiration. To create an emblem, a crest, a personal identifiable piece of art that will say _who I am_. Now, for those who are reading and do not know the monogram of Tolkien's signature here is a glimpse. Tolkien made for himself a monogram depicting his four initials "J", "R", "R", and "T", all neatly interwoven between each other.

I created something that was rather a mockery myself but found extreme satisfaction in creating it. I first drew it in my sketchbook, as seen in the below photo, and then enclosed a replica sketch to my wife (at the time Fiancee), making her the first to see it :).

To digitize the sketch I then gave it to ChatGPT (gpt-5.3) to render a full version. That is now what you see in the banner on this website and also what you see as the `favicon` at the time of writing this.

## Why?

There is something rather fulfilling in creating a personal logo for myself. The artistic process itself of making manifest the idea in my head was very enjoyable. But beyond that it gives this feeling of crowning achievement. It is like I have had persisted without a name and now am finally given a name. Okay, maybe that is a touch dramatic.. but my point stands. This is something I have created and represents _me_. There are other things out there and probably similar but they are not _mine_. And I say this not in a possessive or greedy sense. For I am glad to share it with whomever. No, this is in a sense of joy rooted in the uniqueness of inner identity. A joy that is rooted in the _man_ created in the image of God. For if I am an image-bearer, and the image that I represent now has an image, one can associate that image with me and subsequently me with God. Therefore, as I bear the image of Gods beautiful creation, this crest bears the image of Gods design.
