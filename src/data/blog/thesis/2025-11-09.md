# Defining problems

Published: true

## Introduction

Some solid progress was made last week with some late nights. I was able to set up some experiments with commercial LLMs and APIs to support the ppx bounding box detection. As well, Ken and I were able to do some slight brainstorming on how we can approach a first problem to solve with respect to the research.

## State of Research

After floating some ideas to Ken I shared the following diagram:

The idea behind this diagram is to show a high level process of how we might be able to turn raw document data into a score of _machine understanding_. My primary interest is in the assessment framework, but out of necessity will need to spend a deal of time in the assumptions (like parsing the data).

After some discussion over email Ken came up with 5 problems that can be solved relatively quickly (each estimated to take about a day). They are as follows:

1. How can we do bounding box based OCR?
2. If we have n different OCR models, can we use ensemble voting to boost the overall performance? Compared to the boosted result (more accurate), can we determine which model is the worst?
3. If we flip two boxes or paragraphs or sentences or words or letters, can LLM restore the original order? This exercise shows level of understanding of causality.
4. Can LLM determine the bounding boxes for questions? This allows us to extract questions from books.
5. Can we mask out the questions, and the ask LLM to solve them?

Thursday (2025-11-06) was spent on problem 1. Mainly, deriving some ability to perform OCR to turn the extracted bounding box images into textual data. This was achieved by setting up API calls to Google Gemini and Mistral OCR. I also set up PP-OCR but found it was incredibly inaccurate. Further expansion for this system is needed.

## Next Steps

In order to move forward there must be refinements in the solution to problem 1. Some things that are needed are to enhance accuracy by sending the bounding box type with the request to the LLM, setting up db storage for API returns, and adding context understanding more than just text detection.

Once there is a satisfactory solution to problem 1 we will then have the building blocks for further problems. Ensemble voting becomes possible with multiple different LLMs producing votes to the content. Then with the content agreed upon with a high degree of confidence we can scramble them to see how the LLMs can determine the correct order. Both of which will require the creation of a ground truth dataset to test the results against.

Problems 4 and 5 are interesting but I think the focus on those comes after we are confident with the results of 1-3. We have a number of coding sessions in the upcoming weeks so I want to use these to get ahead and conduct some quality research.
