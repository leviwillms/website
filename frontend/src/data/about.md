## Who Am I

I'm a technical enthusiast while simultaneously being a digital minimalist. I love building with technology but also understand the danger of over-reliance on the very technologies I build on.

In addition to a love of technology I also love my beautiful wife of (<span class="php-var">$CURRENT_YEAR</span> - <span class="php-var">$YEAR_OF_WEDDING</span>) years. I'm a man of faith, a Protestant Christian, and when I'm not playing with technology or working I'm either reading, playing/watching sports, or spending time with my family.

You can read my soliloquy on reading in my `Interests` page. There you'll see my true love for all things classic literature come to life. What now follows is an Ode to the boxy look, hence the inspiration of my Windows 98 themed personal website.

## Why This Theme?

Straight edges, clear lines, thick shadows, and a touch of nostalgia that reminds the beholder of a pleasant time on the internet. That's why.

Design used to be so simple. We carved a feature out to serve a purpose. Built things that may not _look_ the best but served their purpose (hey, though who's to say it didn't look the best?). For instance, let's take the 1980 Volvo 240. Cars do not get more boxy than that. Though, through it all we look back and see this as a desirable style. Why is that, one might ask? _simplicity_. It doesn't get simpler than four corners, four wheels and roll down windows. In an age where consumerism runs rampant and everyone wants the next best thing the classic cars stand strong as a pillar against the rising tides discontentment.

That being said, why Windows 98 specifically? I mean, for Pete's sake I was born in 2000. But what can I say? I like the look. And that is simply why. I think it looks cool so I built a website using it. Shout out to [@jdan](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/)

## The Website

Now, in conclusion I guess it would be appropriate to talk about the _features_ of the website. The website was built in `React` with `CRA (Create React App)`. I originally started it in the summer of 2025 when I stumbled upon the `98.css` library. I wanted to test out OpenAI's early version of `Codex` (if you used it you remember how bad it was) but was left completely unsatisfied. I mean, it made the decision to use `CRA` instead of `Vite`. So, with a recent love for `Claude Code` I decided to retry this using Claude and man, am I ever blown away. You'll see many features in the site to feel free to go explore. There's some fun easter eggs, first of which you've likely noticed in the boot sequence. I'm lazy so I just decided to host the static files on my domain as you see them now. Maybe I'll add a backend in the future but probably not because that means I'll have to manage it.
