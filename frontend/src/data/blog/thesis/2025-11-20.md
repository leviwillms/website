# Brief update

Today Ken and I had a meeting where we discussed the upcoming poster presentation for mid January 2026. He said that the alignment problem is a good eventual goal for the project but for the time being if we can focus on creating a frontend web app to display the manipulation between these documents.

He says that we can use other multi-modal models to come up with a solution to the alignment problem. Where one is able to interpret where the position of each text, table, or figure is in the text.

But I'm not sure if we need an AI model for this. I believe we can do some discrete analysis of text and come up with solid candidates for where the text is positionally.
