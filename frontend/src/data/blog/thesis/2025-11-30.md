# Differences in OCR results

## Differences in OCR results

It becomes difficult to query mistral OCR for any given string because where the PDF cuts off text, in a paper's dual-column format, ppx creates a single text fragment, and Mistral combines it with the contextual paragraph.

Let's take the following for example in the source document:

```
1  This module can be efficiently implemented using
2  standard operations in any modern framework and al-
3  lows our models to beat state of the art along multiple
4  performance points using standard benchmarks. Fur-
5  thermore, this convolutional module is particularly suit-
6  able for mobile designs, because it allows to signifi-
7  cantly reduce the memory footprint needed during in-
8  ference by never fully materializing large intermediate
9  tensors. This reduces the need for main memory access
10 in many embedded hardware designs, that provide small
11 amounts of very fast software controlled cache memory.
```

This is stored in ppx text_fragments as 11 individual fragments with the literal linear strings. However, when Mistral OCR detects it we'll get the following result:

```
This module can be efficiently implemented using standard operations in any modern framework and allows our models to beat state of the art along multiple performance points using standard benchmarks. Furthermore, this convolutional module is particularly suitable for mobile designs, because it allows to significantly reduce the memory footprint needed during inference by never fully materializing large intermediate tensors. This reduces the need for main memory access in many embedded hardware designs, that provide small amounts of very fast software controlled cache memory.
```

So if we were to run a fuzzy search query on line 6 we'd get no results due to the trailing dash '-'.

```sql
SELECT page_id, text FROM mistral_text_fragments WHERE text ILIKE '%able for mobile designs, because it allows to signifi-%';

 page_id | text
---------+------
(0 rows)
```

But, if the dash is removed we get a result:

```
SELECT page_id, text FROM mistral_text_fragments WHERE text ILIKE '%able for mobile designs, because it allows to signifi%';

 page_id | text
---------+------

Therefore, **we must consider some type of sanitization that detects when a word is split between multiple lines**.
