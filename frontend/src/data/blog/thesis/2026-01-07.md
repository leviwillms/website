# Envisioning the final product

## The Goal

The following is rough outline of the plans of implementation for the final product of the thesis. Once this is in place the next step will be to refine the solution algorithms and testing benchmarks (ensuring accuracy).

```
We want to create a system that will demonstrate this capability with the logical workflow as follows:

1. Upload a PDF document.
2. System runs ppx and Mistral api to break down the content of the document.
3. System runs the precomputation of the vector embeddings and document alignment.
4. A query is sent to the system.
5. The optimal page element coordinates are returned relating to the provided query.

Note that a page element is the bounding box for a collection of text fragments.
```
